Loadmodule authn_google_module modules/mod_authn_google.so

#
# GoogleAuthPath is the root directory to hold user authentication files in.
# This can be specified as either a path relative to Apache's root, or an
# absolute path. For example, if I speified "ga_auth" (as below) and I logged
# in with the username "user" - the module would look for a file called:
# /usr/local/apache2/ga_auth/user  (under my setup) for the user's login
# credendials. This file must be generated from the "google_authenticator"
# program, consisting of the secret key, scratch codes, etc.
#
# GoogleAuthCookieLife specifies how long (in seconds) authentication cookies
# are to last. Not specifying this disables authentication cookies, meaning
# "sessions" will only last about a minute before needed re-authentication.
#
# EntryWindow specifies the "leeway" in how exact the time has to be for a
# proper authentication to occur. "0" would mean it must be exact. "1" 
# would mean it will except one entry newer or older. (About +/- 30 seconds)
# "2" would accept entries +/- 60 seconds. The default value is "1". Higher
# numbers can be used to account for clocks not being entirely accureate,
# but are not as secure. This is only used for Basic authenticaiton, as
# Digest authentication will only work with the extact code required at
# the exact present time.
