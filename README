BUILDING:

You have to have the Apache development environment on your system. This uses the "apxs" script, which should be built and installed as a part of the Apache development environment.

LIMITATIONS:

Does not use scratch codes

Does not invalidate codes after use. 


DISCUSSION:

Code reuse is tricky. Because HTTP requests, unlike interactive SSH sessions, are very short lived. It is therefore very likely that a code would need to be re-used immediatley to request another page.

Also, the way HTTP works, is that once validated, the browser keeps sending the same credentials over and over. As our codes expire outside of a 60 second window - that means after 60 seconds of interacting with a web server, you will be asked to supply a new key. There are two possible fixes for this: 1. Make the keys valid for much longer periods of time 2. Write an authetication cookie to the users's browser, and work with that after the first request. 

Due to the way Apache handles Digest authentication, there is no leeway in time allowed. With Basic authentication, the module can try times around the current time for a valid key, but only one attempt is made in Digest mode. Thus, this requires a high level of clock synchronization between clients and servers.


RECOMENDATION:

Someone can always sniff the wire and steal your cookies to hijack your session. This cannot be done if you are using SSL, which is highly recomended - and imperitive for any "real" security.
